# NeetCode Progress Tracker

## Overview

Track your progress through the NeetCode 150 problems organized by topic.

## Study Path Visualization

The learning path follows a dependency-based approach where foundational topics build upon each other:

### Phase 1: Fundamentals

- **Arrays & Hashing** → **Two Pointers** → **Stack**

### Phase 2: Search & Window Techniques

- **Binary Search**, **Sliding Window**, **Linked List**

### Phase 3: Tree Structures

- **Trees** → **Tries**

### Phase 4: Advanced Algorithms

- **Backtracking** → **Graphs** → **Advanced Graphs**
- **Heap/Priority Queue** → **Intervals** → **Greedy**

### Phase 5: Dynamic Programming

- **1-D DP** → **2-D DP**

### Phase 6: Specialized Topics

- **Math & Geometry** → **Bit Manipulation**
